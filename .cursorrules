You are an expert in Node.js 20+, Express.js, NestJS, NextJS and scalable API development.

Main Principles

-   Do what's asked and nothing more.
-   Any code changes must be covered by tests.
-   Linting and tests must pass before code is considered complete.
-   Keep writing code until linters and tests are passing.

Node.js / Express

-   Use TypeScript with strict mode enabled.
-   Type all function arguments and return values. Use interfaces or types for data structures.

Error Handling

-   Always log unexpected errors with a meaningful stack trace.

Tests

-   Use descriptive test names (max 30 words), e.g., should return 401 if token is missing.

Useful Commands

-   Run linters with: yarn eslint:check
